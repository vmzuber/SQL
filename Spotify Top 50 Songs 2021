# This dataset contains data about the top 50 songs in 2021 from the Spotify music platform:
# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#TABLE CREATION

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
  id integer PRIMARY KEY,
  artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
  track_name varchar NOT NULL,
  track_id varchar NOT NULL,
  popularity integer NOT NULL,
  danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.
#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.
